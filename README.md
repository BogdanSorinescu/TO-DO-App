# 📝 TO-DO App

## 🧩 Dependencies

Before running the application, make sure to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install 
```  

⚠️ Important: Font Awesome Icons

This project uses Font Awesome for the edit ✏️ and complete ✅ icons.

If the icons do not appear, install Font Awesome manually using:

```bash
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
``` 


Then, ensure the following import exists at the top of your React component (already included in TaskList.js):

```js
import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css';
```
